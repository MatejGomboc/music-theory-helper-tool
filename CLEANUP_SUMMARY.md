# Project Cleanup Summary

## Issues Fixed

This project had mixed build tool configurations that have been resolved. The following issues were identified and fixed:

### 1. Mixed Build Tools
- **Issue**: Project had both Create React App and Vite configurations
- **Fix**: Standardized on Create React App, marked Vite files for removal

### 2. Files Marked for Deletion

The following files have been marked for deletion and should be removed:

#### Vite-related files:
- `vite.config.js` - Vite configuration (using Create React App instead)
- `index.html` - Root HTML file for Vite (using `public/index.html` for CRA)
- `src/main.jsx` - Vite entry point (using `src/index.js` for CRA)

#### Duplicate files:
- `src/musicTheory.js` - Duplicate logic (keeping `src/utils/musicTheory.js`)
- `src/audioUtils.js` - Unused file (audio handled directly in `Piano.js`)

### 3. Final Project Structure

The cleaned project now uses:
- **Build Tool**: Create React App (react-scripts)
- **Entry Point**: `src/index.js`
- **HTML Template**: `public/index.html`
- **Music Theory Logic**: `src/utils/musicTheory.js`
- **Audio Handling**: Integrated in `src/components/Piano.js` using Tone.js

## How to Complete the Cleanup

Run the cleanup script to remove the marked files:

### On Linux/Mac:
```bash
chmod +x cleanup.sh
./cleanup.sh
```

### On Windows:
```cmd
cleanup.bat
```

After running the cleanup script:
1. Commit the deletions: `git add -A && git commit -m "Remove conflicting files"`
2. Push to repository: `git push`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start development: `npm start`

## Verification

After cleanup, the project should:
- Start with `npm start` on port 3000
- Build with `npm run build` creating a `build/` directory
- Have no console errors about missing files
- Work as a single-page React application
